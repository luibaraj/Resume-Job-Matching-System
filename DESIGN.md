# Embedding Model

## Voyage AI `voyage-3.5-lite`

My main constraints are good performance for symmetric retrieval (query is approximately the same length as the documents) and low cost. This Voyage AI model provides competitive performance for retrieval tasks, a generous free tier, and still presents low cost after the free tier is diminished. The main caveat is that this model has an asymmetric design and prepends text based on if the input is a query, document, or none. Since we are comparing content-to-content and not question-to-answer, we can simply set input type to none so that prepending is skipped entirely.

# Preprocessing Pipeline

These steps were curated based on the data quality report provided by inspect_raw_jobs.py.

1. Unescape HTML entities for downstream steps to work on real HTML.
2. Strip iframe and image tags entirely.
3. Explain plain text from clean HTML.
4. Normalize whitespace.
5. Normalize unicode puncutation with ASCII equivalents.

# Vector Database

## Chroma

The Chroma vector database is lightweight and great for prototyping, and it can still reach high recall accuracy if tuned properly.
